# My_Home_Assistant_Config
I'm going to try to keep this up to date as often as I can so anyone can take a look.  Please do send me a message if you have any questions and ESPECIALLY if you notice something in here that may be a security breach for me!  Have fun and hope this helps!

# Major Update
Hello! I restructured my configuration so most of my components are broken out into separate yaml files and I added them to a Configurations folder. This helps me keep my sanity when working on my config so I dont have to find my files spread out between all the various HA files in the config folder. :-)
